# Voyager curated servers policy

[servers.ts](./servers.ts) contains whitelisted and categorized instances.

Please feel free to open an issue or PR to add an instance to, provided the instance meets the following criteria:

1. Server uptime of at least 3 months
2. At least 50 MAU, **UNLESS:**
   1. a regional or niche category instance, or
   2. added only to `ADDITIONAL_LOGIN_INSTANCES` (only shown for login, not signup)
3. Commitment to provide 2 months lead time before shut down
4. Active moderation against harassment, bullying, racism, discrimination, transphobia, hate speech, violation of privacy and threats of violence.
5. Privacy Policy and Terms of Use set up on `/legal` page

The above policy can be bypassed for instances added by me (aeharding). I reserve the right to refuse to add an instance for any reason without explanation.
